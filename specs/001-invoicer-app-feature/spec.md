# Feature Specification: Invoicer App Feature

**Feature Branch**: 001-invoicer-app-feature  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "invoicer-app feature"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A business user needs to create, manage, and send invoices to clients while tracking payments and maintaining financial records.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a business user with an account, **When** I create a new invoice, **Then** I can add line items, set amounts, and send it to a client
2. **Given** I have sent invoices to clients, **When** I view my invoice history, **Then** I can see the status of each invoice (pending, paid, overdue)
3. **Given** I have overdue invoices, **When** I use the system, **Then** I can send reminder notifications to clients

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to create an invoice without any line items?
- How does the system handle duplicate invoice numbers?
- What happens when I try to delete an invoice that has already been paid?
- How does the system handle currency conversions for international clients?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and customize professional invoices with client information and line items
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to send invoices directly to clients via email
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to track invoice status (draft, sent, paid, overdue)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide payment tracking and reconciliation capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate financial reports and analytics for business insights
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multiple currencies for international clients
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to set up recurring invoices for subscription-based services
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to upload and attach supporting documents to invoices

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: System MUST support client management with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: client onboarding process not specified - self-registration, admin invitation, manual entry?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST retain invoice data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - legal requirements? business needs?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle payment processing via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: payment processor not specified - Stripe, PayPal, bank transfer?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Invoice**: Represents a billing document containing client information, line items, totals, and payment status
- **Client**: Represents a business or individual entity that receives invoices with contact and billing information
- **Line Item**: Represents individual products or services within an invoice with description, quantity, rate, and amount
- **Payment**: Represents payment transactions linked to invoices with amount, date, and method
- **User**: Represents system users with permissions for creating and managing invoices and clients
