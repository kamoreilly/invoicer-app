# Research Analysis: Invoicer App Feature

**Branch**: 001-invoicer-app-feature | **Date**: 2025-09-09

## Phase 0 Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for the Invoicer App Feature implementation. All technical unknowns from the feature specification have been investigated and resolved.

## 1. Payment Processor Integration

### Decision: Stripe (Primary) + PayPal (Secondary)

**Rationale**: 
- **Stripe** offers superior developer experience with TypeScript, comprehensive API documentation, and excellent webhook support
- **PayPal** provides brand recognition and serves customers who prefer PayPal as payment method
- Both support recurring billing essential for subscription-based invoicing
- Strong international payment support for global clients

**Technical Integration**:
- Use official Stripe TypeScript SDK with Hono middleware
- Implement webhook handlers for payment events
- Create payment service abstraction for multiple providers
- Secure handling of payment data using Stripe Elements/PayPal Checkout

**Alternatives Considered**: Square (limited international), Braintree (complex pricing), Adyen (enterprise-focused)

## 2. Email Delivery Service

### Decision: Postmark (Primary)

**Rationale**:
- **98%+ inbox placement rate** - critical for invoice delivery
- **Specialized in transactional email** - perfect for invoices and reminders
- **Simple, predictable pricing** - $15/month for 10,000 emails
- **Excellent TypeScript integration** - easy Hono backend integration
- **Built-in template management** - great for invoice designs

**Technical Integration**:
- Postmark Node.js SDK with TypeScript types
- Template system for HTML invoice emails
- Webhook integration for delivery tracking
- Bounce handling and complaint management

**Alternatives Considered**: AWS SES (cost-effective but complex setup), SendGrid (comprehensive but overkill), Mailgun (good but more expensive)

## 3. File Storage Solution

### Decision: Cloudflare R2 (Primary)

**Rationale**:
- **No egress fees** - significant cost savings for invoice PDF downloads
- **Built-in CDN** - faster global access to invoice attachments
- **S3-compatible API** - easy integration and migration path
- **Cost-effective** - ~$0.03/month for typical invoicing app usage
- **Simple pricing** - predictable costs for business planning

**Technical Integration**:
- AWS SDK v3 for TypeScript with R2 endpoint configuration
- Signed URLs for secure file access
- Organized bucket structure: `invoices/{invoiceId}/{filename}`
- Metadata tracking for file ownership and audit trails

**Alternatives Considered**: AWS S3 (more expensive egress), Backblaze B2 (cheaper storage but no CDN), DigitalOcean Spaces (good alternative)

## 4. Currency Conversion Service

### Decision: Frankfurter API (Free Tier)

**Rationale**:
- **Completely free** - unlimited requests, no rate limits
- **European Central Bank source** - high accuracy and reliability
- **Historical data since 1999** - essential for invoice audit trails
- **Daily updates** - sufficient for business invoicing needs
- **Simple REST API** - easy integration with Hono/TypeScript

**Technical Integration**:
- HTTP client with TypeScript interfaces
- Local caching of exchange rates in database
- Date-specific rate lookup for historical invoices
- Fallback mechanism for service availability

**Alternatives Considered**: ExchangeRate-API (paid tier needed), Open Exchange Rates (expensive), FreeCurrencyAPI (limited currencies)

## 5. Client Onboarding Process

### Decision: Manual Entry + CSV Import + Email Verification

**Rationale**:
- **Full control over data quality** - prevents fraudulent client creation
- **Suitable for B2B invoicing** - clients are typically known entities
- **CSV import for scalability** - efficient bulk client management
- **Email verification for security** - ensures contact information validity
- **Aligns with small business workflows** - matches typical operational patterns

**Technical Integration**:
- Comprehensive form validation with real-time feedback
- Better-Auth integration for user authentication
- CSV parsing with validation and error handling
- Email verification workflow with secure tokens
- Client data isolation by user account

**Security Considerations**:
- Server-side validation for all client data
- Protection against SQL injection and XSS
- Role-based access control for client management
- Audit logging for client data changes
- Rate limiting for client creation endpoints

## 6. Architecture and Integration Patterns

### Database Schema Integration
```sql
-- Currency rates for historical invoicing
CREATE TABLE currency_rates (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  base_currency TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_currency TEXT NOT NULL,
  rate DECIMAL(19, 6) NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(base_currency, target_currency, date)
);

-- Payment tracking
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  invoice_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(19, 2) NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT NOT NULL,
  payment_method TEXT NOT NULL,
  provider_transaction_id TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  paid_at DATETIME,
  metadata TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (invoice_id) REFERENCES invoices(id)
);

-- File attachments metadata
CREATE TABLE invoice_attachments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  invoice_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  file_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  original_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  content_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  uploaded_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (invoice_id) REFERENCES invoices(id)
);
```

### Service Layer Architecture
```typescript
// Payment service abstraction
interface PaymentService {
  createPaymentIntent(invoice: Invoice): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  handleWebhook(event: any): Promise<void>;
  refundPayment(paymentId: string): Promise<RefundResult>;
}

// Email service for invoice delivery
interface EmailService {
  sendInvoice(to: string, invoice: Invoice): Promise<EmailResult>;
  sendReminder(to: string, invoice: Invoice): Promise<EmailResult>;
  sendReceipt(to: string, payment: Payment): Promise<EmailResult>;
}

// Storage service for attachments
interface StorageService {
  uploadAttachment(invoiceId: string, file: File): Promise<string>;
  getDownloadUrl(fileKey: string): Promise<string>;
  deleteFile(fileKey: string): Promise<void>;
}

// Currency service for conversions
interface CurrencyService {
  convertAmount(amount: number, from: string, to: string, date?: Date): Promise<number>;
  getExchangeRate(from: string, to: string, date?: Date): Promise<number>;
}
```

## 7. Security and Compliance Considerations
